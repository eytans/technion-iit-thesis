Automated theory exploration has previously been successfully applied to discover lemmas for inductive theories, about recursive datatypes and functions. We present an extension of theory exploration to coinductive theories, allowing us to explore the dual notions of corecursive datatypes and functions. This required development of new methods for testing infinite values, and for proof automation. Our work has been implemented in the Hipster system, a theory exploration tool for the proof assistant Isabelle/HOL.",

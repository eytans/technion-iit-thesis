Deductive reasoning, a cornerstone of logical thought, forms the basis for many powerful techniques in automated reasoning systems. 
At its core, deductive reasoning involves drawing logical conclusions from a set of premises, applying general principles to specific instances. 
This approach has become instrumental in automatically proving properties of software systems, optimizing code, and discovering new mathematical truths.

Automatic deductive reasoning is mostly used for software development and validation.
As software systems have become increasingly complex, the importance of automated reasoning has grown significantly \cite{d2008survey}. 
Methods of optimization and verification are more crucial than ever, as software is embedded in critical infrastructure, from financial systems to healthcare devices.
Thus, automated reasoning techniques have been a center of attention for many years\footnote{But, attention is not all you need}. 
One of the fundamental approaches in this field is term rewriting. 
Term rewriting involves systematically replacing subterms of a formula with equivalent terms according to a set of rewrite rules. 
For example, in arithmetic, we might have a rule that states $a + b - b \rightarrow a$ where $a$ and $b$ are arbitrary terms. 
This rule would allow us to simplify expressions like $5 + (x\cdot y) - (x\cdot y)$ to just $5$.

While powerful, term rewriting faces several challenges:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Termination: It's not always clear whether the rewriting process will terminate, especially with complex rule sets.
    \item Confluence: Even when termination is guaranteed, different rewriting sequences might lead to different normal forms, complicating reasoning about term equivalence.
    \item Information loss: Once a rewrite step is taken, the original term is typically discarded, potentially losing valuable information for later reasoning steps.
\end{enumerate}

To address some of these issues, techniques like the Knuth-Bendix completion algorithm \cite{knuthbendixcompletion} have been developed. 
This algorithm attempts to transform a set of equations into a confluent and terminating term rewriting system. 
That is, using the rewrite system on two provably equal terms will result in both terminating with the same normal form.
However, it doesn't fully solve the problem of information loss and can struggle with certain types of equations. 
For example, the commutativity of addition, $x + y \rightarrow y + x$, poses challenges for the Knuth-Bendix completion algorithm. 
If included directly as a rewrite rule, it can lead to non-termination \cite{kapur1985knuthintro}.

Equality saturation, a relatively new deductive reasoning technique that has emerged as a promising solution to many of these challenges \cite{eqsat}. 
It is based on e-graphs \cite{egg}, a data structure that can compactly represent a large set of equivalent terms.
In this context, a term is a symbolic expression that represents a mathematical expression or computation, typically composed of variables, constants, and function symbols, such as  $f(x+2)$ and $3 \cdot y^2$.
An easy way to think about e-graphs is as an extension of the union-find data structure to include congruence closure over terms.
In an e-graph, each node (called an e-class) represents a set of terms that are known to be equal.
Edges in the e-graph (somewhat confusingly called e-nodes) represent function applications.
For example, if we know that $a = b$ and $f(a) = c$, an e-graph could represent the terms $\{ a, b, c, f(a), f(b) \}$ with two e-classes $\{ e1, e2 \}$ and four e-nodes: $e1  = {a, b}$, $e2 = {f(|e1|), c}$.
Do note that $a$, $b$, and $c$ are treated as unary functions, and e-nodes are over e-classes, so we mark $|e1|$ to signify the parameter is the e-class $e1$.
The compact representation is based on shared subterms, so in the worse case no subterms are shared and no compaction is achieved.
However, an e-graph can also represent infinite expressions in a single e-class.
Let's take for example $x$ and $x + 0$.
Both will be in the same e-class $e$, but the e-node $|e| + 0$ is over any term represented by $e$, inductively leading to infinite terms.

Equality saturation employs e-graphs to build a compact representation of all possible rewrites of a given expression. 
Instead of applying rewrite rules sequentially and discarding intermediate results, equality saturation applies all possible rewrites simultaneously, storing the results in the e-graph. 
This approach allows for a more comprehensive exploration of the solution space without committing to a particular sequence of rewrites. 
The power of equality saturation has been demonstrated across various applications:

\paragraph{Program Optimization} Equality saturation has, originally and in later work, been used to discover complex code transformations that significantly improve performance \cite{eqsat}.
It's main advantage is the ability to choose global optimizations rather than local ones through classical heuristic rewriting.
Another instance, the TENSAT superoptimizer, uses equality saturation to find optimized tensor graphs \cite{tensat} which is important for the recent surge in deep learning tools and applications.
Similarly, the Herbie tool \cite{herbie} applies equality saturation achieving greatly improved accuracy of floating-point expressions.

\paragraph{Program Verification and Theorem Proving}
Equality saturation has also made significant strides in the domains of program verification and theorem proving. 
TheSy \cite{thesy}, which is part of the contributions of this thesis, leverages equality saturation for theory exploration, automatically discovering and proving new lemmas in mathematical theories.
In the realm of program analysis, the combination of abstract interpretation with equality saturation \cite{abstracteqsat} has shown promise in improving the precision and efficiency of static analysis tools. 
Equality saturation has been employed in fuzz testing of compilers as well. 
WASM Mutate \cite{arteaga2022wasm} to generate semantically equivalent mutations, aiding in testing and verification efforts of WASM compilers. 
Furthermore, an issue with using equality saturation (and its inherently applied congruence closure) was that proof traces could be difficult to verify. 
This is important, as usually verification systems like the Coq proof assistant \cite{Coq:manual} work on a small trusted core, and are often used to verify proofs from external tools \cite{armand2011modular, coqhammer}. 
The "Small Proofs from Congruence Closure" technique \cite{flatt2022small} demonstrates how equality saturation can be used to generate compact proofs from e-graphs, bridging the gap for equality saturation to be used in automated reasoning systems.

\paragraph{Program Synthesis} Equality saturation has proven to be particularly effective in program synthesis tasks due to its ability to compactly represent vast search spaces of potential programs.
This compact representation allows for efficient exploration of numerous program variants simultaneously.
For instance, the Babble synthesizer \cite{cao2023babble} leverages equality saturation to compress learned libraries of function, exploring a wide range of implementation choices in a single e-graph. 
In the domain of rewrite rule inference Ruler \cite{ruler} uses equality saturation to automatically discover new term rewriting rules from a set of input-output examples, effectively synthesizing program transformations. 
This approach has shown promise in automating the discovery of optimization rules for domain-specific languages. 
Furthermore, in the field of computer-aided design (CAD), the Szalinski tool \cite{nandi2020synthesizing} uses e-graphs to represent and manipulate CAD programs, enabling the synthesis of more abstract, parametric CAD models.

\bigskip

Despite these successes, the full potential of equality saturation in deductive reasoning remains to be explored. 
Several challenges persist:

\begin{itemize}
    \item While equality saturation is powerful for reasoning within a given theory, its effectiveness is limited to known equalities. Automatically discovering new theories or extending existing ones remains challenging.
    \item Handling conditions efficiently in the e-graph structure is not straightforward, limiting the applicability of equality saturation in scenarios involving complex logical conditions.
    \item Applicability for theorem provers is still an open problem. While rewriting systems were successfully employed in theorem provers, equality saturation has still not made a big footprint in the field.
\end{itemize}

This thesis aims to address these challenges and advance the field of deductive reasoning through novel applications and extensions of equality saturation.

\section{Expanding the Knowledge Base in Automated Reasoning}

In the context of automated deductive reasoning, \emph{knowledge base} refers to the set of facts, axioms, lemmas, and theorems that a system can use to derive new conclusions \cite{amlenat1977automated, thesy}.
For instance, in arithmetic reasoning, the knowledge base might include basic axioms like $x + y = y + x$ or more complex theorems like distribution of addition and multiplication $x * (y + z) = (x * y) + (x * z)$.

Automatic deduction based on a given knowledge base will fail when missing an important axiom.
For example, consider trying to find a proof for the equality $(y * 0) + x = x$.
Of course, if the knowledge base contains that equality directly then it is easy, it also can be deduced with a combination of axioms, $\forall y. y * 0 = 0$ and $\forall x. 0 + x = x$, it would be provable in two steps.
But, when the knowledge base would not contain relevant and matching axioms, the automatic deductive reasoning will fail.

For that reason, scientists devote a lot of effort into developing theories \cite{qedatlarge}.
To that end, the concept of automatically expanding this knowledge base, known as theory exploration, has been researched as well.
Theory exploration can be defined as the task of automatically discovering new, interesting, and provably correct mathematical knowledge from a given set of axioms and definitions.
Over the years, various approaches to theory exploration have been developed.

Starting already in the 1970s, researchers have developed systems for potentially increasing the knowledge base by heuristically discovering concepts (e.g. a circle, or prime numbers) and conjectures about them. \cite{amlenat1977automated,buchanan1981dendral}.
Generate-and-test methods, like the GRAPH THEORIST and HR systems \cite{epstein1988graphtheist,colton1999automatichr}, which generate conjectures, but then also attempt to prove them, thus improving usability.
All of these works depend greatly on the representation (or embedding) of the concepts to create conjectures and new concepts, due to the, often infinite, search space of conjectures to consider.

Newer methods attempt to deal with the search space explosion problem by using constrained synthesis and fast conjecture filtering, but do not attempt to recognize new concepts.
IsaCoSy \cite{JAR2010:Johanssonisacosy}, uses constraint-based synthesis to generate conjectures while trying to maintain completeness.
Other systems use templates as a heuristic to constrain or simplify conjecture generation \cite{einarsdottir2020template,ESA2012:Montanoschemebased,mccasland2006mathsaid}. 

More recent, and especially successful, approaches rely on equality relations as a means to compress the search space.
QuickSpec \cite{JFP2017:Smallbonequickspec2, claessen2010quickspec1} uses observable equality (equality over a finite set of examples) as an equality relation.
However, observable equality suffers from two big issues.
First, it requires concrete examples to run, which QuickSpec partially solves by relying on the property testing. 
The second problem arises because observable equality may imply incorrect equalities leading to wrong conjectures, but further work, HipSpec \cite{hipster}, uses theorem provers on top of QuickSpec to circumvent correctness issues.
Additional work went into extending support for conditionals, improving runtime using schemes, and infinite streams \cite{ESA2012:Montanoschemebased, hipstercond, einarsdottir2020template, 2018AISC:Einarsdottir}, but the basic limitations of creating examples, especially for conditional conjectures, such as conjectures about concepts, remain.

Currently theory exploration still faces challenges when trying to fulfill all three goals at once:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Efficiency: Generating and testing a large number of conjectures can be computationally expensive.
    \item Relevance: Many generated statements, while true, may not be useful or interesting.
    \item Completeness: Find all important theorems in a given domain. Especially challenging when considering conditional conjectures such as $sorted~list \implies min~list = head~list$, as they require generating more conjectures, and non-equality ones at that.
\end{itemize}

TheSy, one of the main contributions of this thesis, addresses these challenges by creating symbolic theory exploration based on equality saturation.
Unlike previous approaches that either rely on concrete evaluation or don't use equality to shrink the search space, TheSy manages to do both by cleverly applying equality saturation.
By representing a large space of equivalent expressions compactly in an e-graph, TheSy can simultaneously consider many potential lemmas. 
Moreover, TheSy's integration with equality saturation provides a symbiotic relationship: as new lemmas are discovered, they can be immediately incorporated into the e-graph, potentially enabling the discovery of even more complex relationships. 
This continuous expansion of the knowledge base is key in dealing with increasingly complex problems, potentially scaling up the theory exploration process.
In \autoref{chap:thesy}, we will delve deeper into TheSy's architecture, algorithms, and its effectiveness in automated theory exploration, demonstrating how it advances the state of the art in expanding knowledge bases for automated reasoning systems.

\section{Conditional Reasoning in Equality Saturation}

While e-graphs excel at representing and manipulating sets of unconditionally equivalent expressions,
real-world scenarios involve conditionals, where the equivalence of expressions depends on certain conditions being met. 
For example, consider the expression $min(x,~y) + max(x,~y)$.
A human reasoner quickly realizes that whether $x < y$ or $x \geq y$, the result will be the same, $x + y$.
But, for an automated reasoner, if no judgement of the sort exists, it will need to choose to split the reasoning process on $x < y$, and use the definition of $min$ and $max$ in each reasoning branch.

The main challenge lies in the fact that an e-graph represents a single global equality relation, and saying a fact like $x < y = true$ will affect all expression contained in it, including, for example, $max(x,~y)$.
Reasoning about each case separately will require a separate e-graph.
Of course, it is possible to clone the e-graph,
and thus have multiple equality relations at once.
TheSy \cite{thesy} (part of this thesis) uses this cloning approach to handle different conditions. 
When encountering a conditional, TheSy creates separate copies (clones) of the e-graph for each branch of the condition.
Back to the example, given the expression $min(x,~y) + max(x,~y)$, TheSy would create two e-graph clones:
1. One where $x < y$ is assumed true, and $min(x,~y) + max(x,~y)$ is simplified to $x + y$.
2. Another where $x \geq y$ is assumed true, and $min(x,~y) + max(x,~y)$ is simplified to $y + x$, which is found equal to $x + y$ through the addition commutativity rule.

This approach allows for powerful conditional reasoning, as each clone can apply rewrites and simplifications specific to its assumed condition. However, it comes at a significant cost in terms of memory usage and computational efficiency, especially when dealing with multiple nested conditions.

Several ad-hoc approaches have been developed to address this challenge, each with its own trade-offs.
The original equality saturation work \cite{eqsat} introduced a local form of condition handling by a adding a new context under conditional flow control, where the environment (i.e. the equality relation and each variable) are duplicated.
This is very useful for running optimizations, and is used for both $if$ statements and loops in E-PEGs (Equality-Program Expression Graphs).
This allowed for some conditional reasoning, but was not a generally applicable solution.
Another approach to conditional reasoning in e-graphs was introduced in a work combining abstract interpretation with e-graphs \cite{abstracteqsat}.
They proposed the use of \emph{ASSUME} nodes to capture constraints and essentially separates the relevant sub-graphs under the constraint.
This is a useful approach, that reused the main equality relation, but essentially leads to duplicating the e-graph under different ASSUME nodes, limiting it's applicability.

The challenges and limitations of existing approaches to conditional reasoning in e-graphs motivate the development of new techniques that can maintain the benefits of e-graphs while efficiently handling conditionals. 
As part of this thesis colored e-graphs were developed, aiming to provide a more memory-efficient and flexible approach to representing and reasoning about conditional equivalences within the e-graph framework.
Colored e-graphs build upon the insights gained from previous approaches, seeking to combine the expressiveness of conditional reasoning with the efficiency and flexibility that have made e-graphs such a powerful tool in program optimization and automated reasoning. 
By introducing a layered approach to representing multiple equality relations, colored e-graphs offer a promising solution to the challenges of conditional reasoning in equality saturation.

\section{Equality Saturation in Interactive Theorem Proving}

Interactive theorem provers, also known as proof assistants, are software tools that aid in the development of formal proofs of mathematical theorems and the verification of complex software systems. 
Examples include Coq \cite{Coq:manual}, Isabelle/HOL \cite{Book2002:Nipkow}, and Lean \cite{lean}. 
These systems provide a rigorous framework for expressing mathematical statements and constructing proofs, often using higher-order logic to allow for greater expressivity.

In proof assistants, users typically guide the proof process by applying tactics or proof strategies. 
However, as proofs become more complex, the manual effort required can be substantial. 
This has led to increased interest in enhancing proof assistants with automated reasoning capabilities.

One significant challenge in this domain is the efficient search and application of relevant lemmas and definitions. 
Proof assistants often come with extensive libraries containing thousands of lemmas and definitions. 
The sheer volume of available knowledge, combined with the expressivity of higher-order logic, makes it extremely difficult for automated tools to identify and apply the most relevant facts for a given proof goal.

To address this challenge, \emph{hammer} tools have been developed for various proof assistants. These tools, such as Sledgehammer for Isabelle/HOL \cite{sledgehammer} and CoqHammer \cite{coqhammer}, attempt to automatically prove goals by translating them to first-order logic and employing external automated theorem provers. 
While hammers have shown significant success, they face limitations in handling higher-order constructs and can struggle with proofs requiring complex combinations of lemmas.

Equality saturation offers a promising approach to enhance automated reasoning in this context.
Recent work on Guided Equality Saturation \cite{guidedeqsat} has shown how to make equality saturation more effective by using user provided rewrites and goal-directed heuristics to guide the saturation process. 

We take a slightly different approach.
Instead of attempting to create a manually applied tactic, we attempt to create a fully automatic Lightweight Equality Saturation (LES) prover, that can be used as an automatic reasoning framework in the context of proof assistants.
LES is designed as a fast, equality saturation-based automated reasoning tool that can integrate well in an interactive environment. 
It is done by focusing on an intermediate representation of the high order logic formulas, and employing efficient e-graph operations for that representation.
To achieve that LES is integrated with CoqHammer, taking advantage of it's already optimized translation to first order logic.
Thus, by being able to quickly handle search over large amounts of lemmas at once, we hope that LES will become a basic tool in more advanced tools.
